# Random Selector Wheel

This project is a simple random selection wheel implemented in HTML5 and JavaScript.
It allows you to define your own options, store them in the browser's local storage,
and spin a wheel to randomly choose one.

Open `index.html` in a browser or deploy it via GitHub Pages to use it.
